## Leading Reactjs Design Patterns

1. The HOC (High Order Component) Pattern

    A JavaScript function that accepts a component as an argument. After inserting or putting additional data and functionality into the component, it then returns another component.

2. The Provider Pattern

    The provider pattern uses a provider component that stores global data and distributes it through the application's component tree to consumers or custom hooks.

3. Presentational and Container Component Patterns

    Presentational and Container patterns enable us to distinguish between different concerns, such as complicated stateful logic, and other features of a component.

    Presentational Components – These stateless functional elements care about relating data to the display.

    Container Components – These components are known to keep track of their internal state and life cycle. They contain presentational details and data-fetching logic.

4. The Hooks Pattern

5. Render Prop Pattern

    This pattern involves passing a function as a prop to a component, allowing the component to render dynamic content.
